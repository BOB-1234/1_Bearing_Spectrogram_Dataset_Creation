This code will allow to replicate the uploaded Mendeley pre-processed datasets with the steps provided.

1. Download the entire subdirectory from github
2. Download the dataset of UODS_VAFDC from;

https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/y2px5tg92h

Sehri, Mert; Dumond, Patrick (2023), “University of Ottawa Ball-bearing Vibration and Acoustic Fault Data under Constant Load and Speed Conditions (UODS-VAFDC)”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/y2px5tg92h.1

3. Place the downloaded 5 folders 1_Healthy, 2_Inner_Race_Faults, 3_Outer_Race_Faults, 4_Ball_Faults, 5_Cage_Faults into the
UODS_spectrogram_datasets folder

4. Open and run the 1_Spectrogram_Dataset_Creation.py

5. Once the code runs fully for 1_Healthy, 20 sub-folders should be created in the UOD_VAFDC/1_Healthy/

6. Each subfolder should have 400 images totaling 12,000 images per column of data created

7. In the code change the folder names with the help of the comments to save the other 4 fault data type subfolders until complete
